# Navigate-the-Stars

## Description 

This is a program that aims to provide accurate and real-time estimations about the location of a shooting star/asteroid based on the user's current location and a selected date range the user has selected. This is done through using the NASA Api to find many of the different asteroids and using Astrophysics calculations to find the location based on specific attributes about the celestial object.


## Instalation

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
